# Bartholomew
## An interactive sound sculpture that communicates via magnetism and vibration


What is it? Is it alive? Can it understand me? Bartholomew is an interactive sculpture that probes the anthropomorphic nature of the non-human, allowing visitors to make face to face contact with an entity that moves and communicates via magnetism vibration. The creature is made of a non-newtonian fluid called Oobleck which changes its viscosity depending on the amount of force applied to it. The substance comes to life when placed on a vibrating metal plate, forming texture and geometry straight from another dimension. Bartholomew has a propensity for human contact, reacting and learning, allowing onlookers to explore abstract dialog with what might be alien life. While its form may be foreign, its behavior implies we may be more closely related than we realize.
